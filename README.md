War Machine   
by [Chris Novello](http://chrisnovello.com) ([@paperkettle](http://www.twitter.com/paperkettle))   

War Machine is a videogame module in the [illucia.com](http://illucia.com) system (it is controlled entirely using OSC). Missiles rain from War Machine's the sky and you can destroy them with explosions generated by a crosshair. 

Tips: Control the X&Y coordinates of the crosshairs with 2 knobs for a very strange etch-a-sketch. Sample colors from other programs and use them for War Machine's explosions for an abstract paint plotter. Use the the X/Y coordinates of exploded missiles to control paramaters in other programs.

You'll need the [oscP5 library](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscP5/).

Custom Max Externals are also included in this release. If you're a Max user, this makes using Stand Stijl extremely easy.

This is rough&quick code that I wrote a few years back when I was learning to program. I figure others might like to tinker with it, just be warned that my design is from when I was starting and is kind of clumsy.
